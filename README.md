# Basic Git Configuration

It is very helpful to have a [`.gitconfig` file](https://git-scm.com/book/tr/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration). You can have a global one that sets defaults on all git repositories (`~/.gitconfig`) and then repository specific `.gitconfig` files as well.

To start with, make sure that you have a global `.gitconfig` that sets your username, email, and your editor of choice for writing `commit` messages.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Firstname LastName"
git config --global user.email "yourEmail@email.com"
git config --global core.editor "yourFavoriteTextEditor"
```

To check the settings of your `.gitconfig` you can either just list it out

```bash
cat ~/.gitconfig
```

or you can query it for specific commands

```bash
git config user.name
```

## Helpful aliases

I would also recommend setting up the following aliases

```bash
git config --global alias.pl 'pull --rebase'
git config --global alias.glog 'log --graph --oneline --decorate --all'
git config --global alias.fstatus '!git fetch -p && git status'
git config --global alias.outgoing '!f() { git fetch && git log origin/$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)..; }; f'
git config --global alias.incoming '!f() { git fetch && git log ..origin/$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD); }; f'
```

For more high-powered Git aliases I'd recommend [Tim Pettersen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-pettersen-5833974/)'s [Git Merge 2017 talk](https://youtu.be/3IIaOj1Lhb0).

# This is a walkthrough of how to do some basic things in Git

On GitHub/GitLab make a new repo called `my-repo`. Use the web GUI to copy the URL to your clipboard and then clone it to your local machine

```bash
git clone <the URL you copied>
cd my-repo
```

GitHub                                          | GitLab
:---------------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------:
![copy URL GitHub](/images/copyURL_GitHub.png)  | ![copy URL GitLab](/images/copyURL_GitLab.png)

Create a `README` and [license](http://choosealicense.com/) for your repo

```bash
touch README.md
# edit README as desired
touch LICENSE
# edit LICENSE as desired
```

Add and commit the files

```bash
git add README.md
git add LICENSE
git commit -m "add README and LICENSE"
# have the changes be tracked
git push -u origin master
```

# Toy example of a workflow

Create a development branch to do work in

```bash
git checkout -b dev
#git push -u origin dev
```

Make an edit to the `README` such as

```bash
This is a local edit to the README!
```

commit the change

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Edit the README locally"
```

We're going to purposely make a merge conflict later by going to GitHub/GitLab and making an edit to the `README` on the `master` branch on there

```bash
This is an upstream edit to the README from the web!
```

GitHub                                                     | GitLab
:--------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------:
![upstream edit GitHub](/images/upstream-edit_GitHub.png)  | ![upstream edit GitHub](/images/upstream-edit_GitLab.png)

On your local machine switch to master branch

```bash
git checkout master
```

merge<sup id="ref1"><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> the changes made in `dev` onto `master`

```bash
git merge dev
```

Before pushing changes make sure that there were no changes already made, so `fetch` and `merge`

```bash
git fetch
git merge origin/master
```

- **N.B.:** What is happening here is we pulled down the current state of the entire remote repo (`origin`) with `fetch` and then merged the changes that exist in the remote branch (`origin/master`) onto the branch we currently have checked out (`master`)

which will result in the following merge conflict:

```bash
Auto-merging README.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

Edit the `README` to resolve the conflict:

```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is a local edit to the README!
=======
This is an upstream edit to the README from the web!
>>>>>>> origin/master
```

to

```bash
This is a local edit to the README followed by an upstream edit to the README from the web!
```

Then commit and push

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
git push origin master
```

# Edits, Diffs, and Resets

Suppose we make several commits to the `README`

```bash
echo "This is an edit" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Edit 1"
echo "This is another edit" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Edit 2"
```

The `README` has just been put in a `commit`, so if we ask the repo what is different from the current state to the repo state

```bash
git diff README.md
```

it returns nothing. The current state of the files are the same as the last commit to the repo. However, if we now do

```bash
echo "What has changed" >> README.md
git diff README.md
```

we see at the bottom the addition

```bash
 This is an edit
 This is another edit
+What has changed
```

If we now ask what has changed between this current state and the second to last `commit`

```bash
git diff HEAD^ -- README.md
```

we get

```bash
 This is an edit
+This is another edit
+What has changed
```

and the third

```bash
git diff HEAD^^ -- README.md
```

gives

```bash
+This is an edit
+This is another edit
+What has changed
```

If we decide that we don't like the edits that we've made and we want to revert back to how the state the repo was in after the last commit then we can just checkout the `HEAD`

```bash
git checkout HEAD -- README.md
```

and we can see we are back at the last `commit`

```bash
git diff
```

If we decide we want to go back to the state before we made our three consecutive commits then we can just do

```bash
git checkout HEAD^^ -- README.md
```

and `git diff` or `cat README.md` will reveal have recovered the state of the `README` before we made the edits.

- **N.B.:** We have recovered the _state_ of the `README` but we have not undone our commits. Simply checking `git log` shows us this.

  # Example of Matthew's daily workflow

Every directory on my local computer that has code in it is a Git repo. A typical snapshot of what that looks like is

```bash
git branch
* YYYY-MM-DD
  dev
  master
```

though if this repo has a remote then going to look at it will only show you `master` and `dev`.

## Why?

The idea here is that `master` should always be production ready and `dev` should be where the new feature that I'm working on it being tested. However, each day I don't want to possibly contaminate `dev`. So everyday when I start work I (from the `dev` branch) do

```bash
git checkout -b YYYY-MM-DD
```

and then do all my work for the day in the `YYYY-MM-DD` branch. Then at the end of the day I simply

```bash
git checkout dev
git merge YYYY-MM-DD
git branch -d YYYY-MM-DD
```

so dev reflects the day's improvements and as `YYYY-MM-DD` has served its purpose it is removed.

If everything has become a raging dumpster fire (it is 2016 when I'm writing this, so there should _really_ be a raging dumpster fire emoji<sup id="ref2"><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> ðŸ—‘ ðŸ”¥) I can instead do

```bash
git checkout dev
git branch -d YYYY-MM-DD
```

and walk away with no damages to try again tomorrow. :)
